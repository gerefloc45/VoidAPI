    .addChild(rareAttack, 5.0f)      // 5% probability
```

**UntilSuccessNode**

- Converts FAILURE to RUNNING to continue
```java
new UntilSuccessNode(findTargetBehavior, 10) // Max 10 attempts
```

**UntilFailureNode**

## Release Notes

### v0.2.0 Highlights

This release significantly expands VoidAPI's capabilities with production-ready features:

1. **Enhanced Control Flow**: New decorator nodes provide fine-grained control over behavior execution
2. **Movement AI**: Complete pathfinding integration for navigation, following, patrolling, and fleeing
3. **Visual Feedback**: Animation system allows entities to express their AI state visually
4. **Developer Tools**: Comprehensive debugging suite helps identify and fix AI issues quickly

### Migration Guide

No breaking changes from v0.1.0. All existing code continues to work.

New features are additive and can be adopted incrementally.

### Known Issues

- GeckoLib integration is basic and may need entity-specific implementation
- Pathfinding behaviors assume MobEntity - custom entities may need adaptation
- Debug tools file logging requires manual directory creation in some cases

### Future Plans

See [AI-ROADMAP.md](AI-ROADMAP.md) for upcoming features in v0.3.0 and beyond.
